					<h2>1881</h2>
					<p>Back in the 1800's, headphones had nothing to do with music. The first headphones were used for telephone operators created by the "Bell Telephone Inc." and Thomas Edison. The telephone was a machine made of a mouthpiece and a earpiece that sat on a person's shoulder, which weighed 6 to 11 pounds. The headphones were a single earpiece that rested on a person's shoulder.</p>

				 	<h2>1895</h2>
					<p>In 1895, the electrophone system came out and was used for listening to different opera houses during the time between 1895 and 1926. The elctrophone was a really big board full of electrical plug-in holes. People had to plug in the differnt cords on their headphones to the different holes on the electrophone to listen to an opera house. Each opera house station had a combination plug-in holes on the electrophone. This was the time where headphones finally came into music. The headohones were shaped like a Y, it had a stick to be held on, The cords came out from the bottom of the stick, and there were two earpieces on it.</p>

					<h2>1937</h2>
					<p>In 1937, Beyerdynamic, a headphones company, released the first dynamic headphones. These headphones had two earpieces, but it didn't have a stck, it was wore on the head, like how people wear it today. The two earpieces are mostly little speakers that use a coil, magnet, and thin sheet of plastic to create sound. When the coil is charged with elctricity, it creates a magnetic field and causes it to move quickly between the magnet. This motion creates sound waves.</p>

					<h2>1958</h2>
					<p>In 1958, John C.Koss created the first stereo headphones. Stereo headphones are special and unique. They can play different sounds on both earpieces. For example, if you're listening to rock music, you might hear the electric guitar playing on the left earpiece, and you might hear the drums on the right earpiece. This headphone creates a surrounding sound effect.</p>

					<h2>1959</h2>
					<p>At a show in Tokyo, Stax, a DJ, wore the worlds first electorstatic headphones in a show. An elctrostatic headphone's function is similar to that of how a dynamic headphone works. Instead of vibrating a charged coil with magnets, it vibrates a charged, thin diaphgram between the magnets.</p>

					<h2>1979</h2>
					<p>In 1979, headphones slowly began to be portable. One of the most popular portable headphones during the 1970's were the Sony MDR-3L2. These headphones have a light weight, which is under 200 grams and they have a stereo sound effect. People used them to listen to music tapes. The tapes were played in a small, palm sized tape player developed by sony, it was called the TPS-L2 walkman.</p>

					<h2>2000</h2>
					<p>In 2000, Bose released its noise canceling headphones called the quiet comfort line. This headphone cancels external noise and allows users to enjoy their music without being distracted by loud noises. These types of headphones are oftenly used by people when they're on a flight, as it cancels out the loud jet engine noise.</p>

					<h2>2001</h2>
					<p>During 2001, Apple's ipod changed the whole music industry. The ipod could store thousands of songs, and it was so small and portable that it could fit into a person's pocket. Every time an ipod was sold, it would always come with the apple earbuds. The apple earbuds was a big part in headphones, it was much lighter than normal headphones for the fact that it was made of a electric wire and two small dynamic drivers. The electric wire was pliable, which allowed the user to wrap it into a coil for storing it in their pocket.</p>

					<h2>2008</h2>
					<p>In 2008, Dr.Dre, an american rapper, Jimmy Lovine, an entrepreneur, and Monster, a headphones company, joined forces and created Beats by Dre. Dr.Dre designed the beats headphones with deep bass and excellent sound quality in mind. Monster and Jimmy Lovine helped him carry out his goal and produce the headphones. Soon after, beats headphones was so popular that a big majority of NBA players own one.</p>

				<h2>Earbuds</h2>
					<p>Earbuds sit loosely on your ears. They don't have outstanding sound qualities, but they are portable, cheap, and hard to break. These types of earbuds are the most commonly used. </p>
					<img src="http://www.snopes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/girl-killed-earbuds.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>In-Ear-canal Earbuds</h2>
					<p>In-ear-canal earbuds fit deep into your ear canals. They have a great sound quality, and it blocks off a majority of external noise. In ear-canal-buds have a flexible plastic tip. As it fits into your ear, it changes its shape by your in ear structure. Its purpose is to reduce less space in your ears for external noise to enter. It is also hard to break and portable. On the other hand, these earbuds might be uncomfortable, and good sound quality in-ear-canal earbuds are usually expensive.</p>

					</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>Canalbuds</h2>
					<p>canal buds fits right in the end of your ear canal. They are semi noise-blocking, and they have sound quality in between earbuds and in-ear-canal buds.They are comfortable with smaller plastic earbuds, and again, they are hard to break and portable.</p>
					<div id="canal">
					<img src="https://macnn.mnmcdn.com/reviews/ifrogz/luxe-bud-silver.jpg">
					</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>Lightweight Headphones</h2>
					<p>Lightweight headphones fit right outside of the ear and have larger earpieces than earbuds, and most lightweight headphones have good sound quality. These headphones have headbands that go over or around the user's head. The headband's purpose is to secure the two earpieces on the ears. Some can even fold up for portability, but most lightweight headphones break easily.</p>
					<img src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0953/5270/products/03300088_01_7f39f89c-942c-42c2-9ba2-470eaf09aaa4_grande.jpeg?v=1446836147">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>Full-Size Headphones</h2>
					<p>Full-size headphones fully cover your ears. Their paddings on the earpieces are really comfortable, and it blocks some external noise. They also have impressive sound quality. Even though sound generated from the earpieces are loud, most full-size headphone's design can prevent the sound from coming out and distracting others. The disadvantages of these headphones are that they are expensive, heavy, and use a lot of battery. </p>

					</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>Noise cancelling headphones</h2>
					<p>Noise cancelling headphones cancel sound by recording the external noise and mesuring the frequency and the amplitude of the noise's sound wave, in two microphones inserted into both earpieces. Then, the recorded noise wave will be played in its 180 degrees out of phase form in the speaker. The external noise waves and its 180 degrees out of phase form played together will cancel each other and result to silence. These headphones are comfortable, and enables the user to enjoy their music. Although, the user must currently charge the headphones' microphones, and the headphones have poor sound quality.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
					<h2>Bluetooth Stereo Headphones</h2>
					<p>The bluetooth stereo technology lets you play music from any electronical device wirelessly. These headphones usually include volume control and music play back buttons. They are also comfortable. They don't have sound quality as good as full-size headphones, but they have a stereo sound effect, which means that the two earpieces play different sounds of the music to create a surround sound effect. These headphones can come in full-size headphones or light headphones. The disadvantage of these headphones are that the users have to charge it everyday. </p>

				<h2>Sound Waves</h2>
				<p>When something vibrates in a high speed, it pushes air molecules around it. As a result, the pushed air molecules bump and push other air molecules. After an air molecule bumps into another molecule, it moves back to its original place. This continuos pattern of air molecules bumping and pushing each other will continue to happen until this pattern of pushed air molecules or sound wave, loses its energy and stop. All types of headphones or earbuds have something that vibrates inside it, which creates soundwaves.</p>
				<img src="http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/Lwave-v8.gif">
				<h2>Dynamic Headphones</h2>
				<p>Dynamic headphone drivers are composed of two main parts, a permanent magnet, and a voice coil which is attached to a flexible plastic diaphragm. The magnet is in the shape of a ring with a gap that allows the coil to move up and down. The coil is made of copper, which means that if its not charged with electricity, it will not attract with the magnet. However, when elcetricity runs in the coil, it makes it act like a magnet, and when you change the direction of where the electricity flows, it is equivilant to flipping the electromagnet. Since the flow of electricity changes many times in the headphones when music is played, the coil will attract and oppose the force of the permanent magnet many times, which will cause the coil to move up and down. This will cause the diaphrgm to move in a high speed and push the air to create sound.</p>
				<img src="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/io/io45.gif?81223b">
				<h2>Electrostatic Headphones</h2>
				<p>Electrostatic headphone drivers work similar to dynamic headphone drivers, but instead of vibrating the coil, it vibrates the diaphragm. The diaphragm of a electrostatic headphone is composed of a thin layer of plastic that has a thin, flat wire of copper zig-zagging in it, where electricity flows in. The magnets are plates of metal that have air holes for sound to pass through, and there are two covering the diaphragm like a sandwhich.</p>

<p> Imagine you're in an office where thousands of songs are played together, but you can't hear them. What makes these songs unaudible are that everyone in the office are using headphones. Simultaniously, almost every person in the world use headphones, but most people don't know how do they produce sound and when were they developed. I see this as a type of ignorance, so I have created this website to help people to get rid of it. Most importantly, headphones allows people to enjoy and listen their favorite songs without distracting others, and hence, many companies that make headphones slowly developed them to have portability, good sound qualities, and convenience. Lastly, what makes me inspired about these miniature sound machienes is its ability to let me hear my music with the pureness of the sounds.
